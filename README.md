Our team was inspired by the desire to take augmented reality gaming to another level. Our inspiration started off simply with an interest in the use of AR to detect body movement through our device's cameras. Then Building off that, we thought about how cool it would be if we could play games with our friends and families while on a video call, or integrate screen objects with our daily lives, and that was how Parcade was born! We were inspired to make a <ins>p</ins>etit <ins>arcade</ins> (see what we did there?) that didn't require too much hardware from the users and was easily accessible so that people could play games and have fun anywhere and anytime even if they were miles apart. Although our current version is still onlt accessible locally, we plan to continue expanding the project to deploy it live where users from different parts of the world can play together.
